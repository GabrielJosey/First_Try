This is the first website I have ever tried to build on my own. It is one) to complete a requirement for Code Louisville and two) to help a friend who needs a photoraphy website. She wanted it to be “super simple with light colors.”  

Some of the pages might be missing material as she (the photographer) is still trying to decide what she wants on those pages. 

Run index.html to start. It required to use bootstrap and jQuery to get some of the desired effects with a responsive design, a carousel and the hamburger drop down menu.
